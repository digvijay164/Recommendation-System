**Recommendation System**

Description:
Our **MEGA PROJECT** aims to develop a Recommendation System for Students using Python and machine learning techniques. 
The system is designed to provide personalized suggestions and references to students based on their academic performance and areas of interest.

Key Features: 

**Data Processing**:
Preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, normalize data, and perform feature engineering.
Utilizing techniques like Random Forest Classifier for feature selection and importance ranking.

**Modeling**:
Implementing various machine learning algorithms to analyze student data and generate recommendations.
Evaluating models using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.

**Deployment**:
The project is hosted on GitHub for version control and collaboration.
Future plans include deploying the system on a cloud platform for scalability and accessibility.

**Technologies Used**:

**Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)

**Jupyter** Notebook

**GitHub** for version control

**Current Phase**: 
We are currently in the data processing phase, focusing on refining our dataset and selecting the most relevant features using the Random Forest Classifier. 
The next steps involve fine-tuning our models and enhancing the recommendation algorithms.
